<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at George Mason University, under the supervision of [Prof. Weiwen Jiang](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/wjiang8). I also work closely with [Prof. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/) at the University of Notre Dame, [Prof. Jingtong Hu](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jthu/) at the University of Pittsburgh, and [Prof. Lei Yang](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/lyang) at George Mason University.

I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Jilin University, China, and my Master's degree from Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya in Spain.
<p style="color: red;">I'm on the academic job market this year. Please reach out for any opportunities!</p>

Research Interest
------
Design Automation (System) + Medical (Domain) + AI (Method) = Efficient Medical AI System
\\
Summary: My research agenda is anchored in advancing AI technology in the medical domain. I am actively engaged in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for AI systems, medical image computing, and AI fairness. My research goal is to bridge the practice gap between AI and domain applications, especially in achieving fair, energy-efficient, and time-efficient Medical AI Systems.

Professional Experience
------
* TPC Member at IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISLVLSI 2024)
* Major Organizer of 1st ESFair Challenge at ESWEEK 2023  
  
 One of the major organizers for ‚ÄòClassification Track: Fair and Intelligent Embedded System Challenge
(ESFair)‚Äô, at the first Tiny and Fair ML Design Contest, co-located at the Embedded Systems Week
(ESWEEK) 2023. ESFair‚Äô23 was sponsored by the Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA).
23 Teams from over 20 organizations participated in ESFair‚Äô23.
